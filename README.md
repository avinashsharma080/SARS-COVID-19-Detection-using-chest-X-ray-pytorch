COVID-19 detection using Chest X-ray in pytorch.

A deep Learning approach to Detect COVID-19 infected patient using pytorch and to increase model's accuracy, I used a method proposed by Philip Jackson known as Style Augmentor . 

To use the code first move to style augmentor folder and run python setup.py install .

Thereafter Run the jupyter notebook.
